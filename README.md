# CoderAndDecoder
A practice program to explore some cryptographic ideas

A one-time-pad provides encryption/decryption only while the program is running. The next time the program runs the mapping will be different. 
This version of the code creates a new cryptographic pad every time the code loads.

An updated TKinter interface provides a Combobox for selecting actions.
